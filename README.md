- 👋 Hi, I’m @SimonRose808
- 👀 I’m interested in well, a lot of things, but we're on a site for coding nerds so i guess I'm interested in uhmmm... coding? Yes, coding it's good enough!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development. Yes, very generic, I know, but I'm currently studying Django, and I plan to study Html,css,javascript,php this summer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on conquering Mars and create a theocracy with Hannibal Buress as the main divinity.
- 📫 How to reach me put yourself in front of the mirror at midnight, turn on yourself three times with a 18th century candlestick in your hands and say "Bloody Pearl". If you do something wrong, an error 404 will appear in the mirror.
